### Day 1: 13th June 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through [Learn and Understand NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/).

**Thoughts**: I learnt about how node is made up of a C++ core and JavaScript core. Had an introduction to using the debugger in VS code to add breakpoints to
