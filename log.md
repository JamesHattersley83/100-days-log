### Day 0: 12th June 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started work on [Learn and Understand NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/).

**Thoughts:** Learnt about how node is built in C++ and how the Javascript V8 engine works under the hood.

### Day 1: 13th June 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through [Learn and Understand NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/).

**Thoughts**: I learnt about how node is made up of a C++ core and JavaScript core. Had an introduction to using the debugger in VS code to add breakpoints to
JavaScript code. Learnt about how node uses modules and commonJS to organise blocks of code and what first class functions are in JavaScript.

### Day 2: 14th June 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [Learn and Understand NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/).
I also created a git repo that I will use to test any code or write notes on what i have learnt whilst going through the course.

**Thoughts**: I went into more detail about how modules are created and used within node. Learnt about Object literals and how they are structured.

### Day 3: 16th June 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the udemy course [Learn and Understand NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/).
I covered the following topics today.

- Prototypal Inheritance and Function Constructors.
- Pass by Reference and Pass by Value.
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs).
- How Node modules really work with 'require' and 'module.exports'.
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

**Thoughts**: I am really enjoying covering some JavaScript basic concepts again and diving deeper under the hood of node and how modules actually work.
